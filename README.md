# Railway Management System API

This is a Railway Management System API that allows users to register, login, add trains, check seat availability, book seats, and view booking details. Admins have special privileges to add new trains. The API is built using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and JWT for authentication.

2. **User Login**: Users can log in and receive a JWT token for authentication.
3. **Train Management**: Admins can add new trains to the system.
4. **Seat Availability**: Users can check seat availability for specific routes.
5. **Seat Booking**: Users can book available seats on trains.
6. **Booking Details**: Users can view details of their bookings.
7. **Role-based Access**: Admins have elevated privileges for managing trains.
